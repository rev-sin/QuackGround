## Project Overview

QuackGround is a **decentralized marketplace that connects AI with creators**.
Users can collaborate with AI agents to generate artistic works (images, videos, etc.), mint them as **NFTs**, and trade them.
All transactions and activities are powered by the **DuckChain-based \$DUCK token**, fostering a **creative and autonomous ecosystem** led by the community.

QuackGround is not just an NFT marketplace.

> 👉 Through **AI-powered content creation, trend curation, and automated purchasing agents**, it establishes a new form of **creative production and consumption cycle**.

## Core Values

1. **AI-Driven Creation**
   Anyone can create art or video content by simply prompting an AI agent in natural language.

2. **Decentralized Marketplace (DuckChain)**
   NFTs minted on DuckChain can be freely traded, with all transactions recorded transparently on-chain.

3. **Curation & Recommendation**
   AI agents analyze the latest market trends to recommend NFTs → enabling both manual and automated purchases.

4. **Token Economy with \$DUCK**
   \$DUCK tokens are used across content creation, sales, purchases, and community participation.
